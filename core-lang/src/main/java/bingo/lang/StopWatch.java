/**
 * <p>
 * <code>StopWatch</code> provides a convenient API for timings.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * To start the watch, call {@link #start()}. At this point you can:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link #suspend()} the watch to pause it. {@link #resume()} allows the watch to continue. Any time between the
 * suspend and resume will not be counted in the total. At this point, these three options are available again.</li>
 * <li>{@link #stop()} the watch to complete the timing session.</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>
 * It is intended that the output methods {@link #toString()} and {@link #getElapsedMilliseconds()} should only be called after stop,
 * split or suspend, however a suitable result will be returned at other points.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * 1. split(), suspend(), or stop() cannot be invoked twice<br />
 * 2. resume() may only be called if the watch has been suspend()<br />
 * 3. start() cannot be called twice without calling reset()
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * This class is not thread-safe
